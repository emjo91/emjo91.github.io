Emily Johnson - 01-28-2015 - Entry 3
Today went a WHOLE lot more smoothly than yesterday. Impressively so. What I learned today, was how to get objects into a hash more effeciently. I had been struggling quite a bit with that. I've now put arrays inside of hashes and even ojects...which really blew my mind at first...but I'm grasping the concept! I think the thing that struck me most was watching how to build a project like the check splitter and diner club. Watching Andrew just tackle ONE problem at a time. I paniced yesterday and tried to get everything all done at once when I hadn't even accomplished the simplest thing yet. Note to self: Don't panice. Start small!
