Q. What is something you've learned so far that you could probably teach (i.e. explain to a reasonable degree of completion) to an interested but unexperienced friend?
A. Right now that's really hard to say! I feel as if I have a pretty good understanding of the theory of how things work, but actually applying those theories seems to be the death of me. I can make a simple class, with a few methods...but having classes mix together seems to be much more difficult.

Q. What is something you think others in the class understand much better than you. Be very, very specific. Even if you're feeling insecure and want to say, "Pretty much everything". Pick something specific.
A. I would definitely say most of them have a better understanding on how classes interact with eachother, and a better idea of how the syntax looks. I think another part I struggle with is learning how to change my way of problem solving.

Q. Describe one or two highlights from this week that have nothing to do with coding.
A. Hah, the first easy question! I got tickets to see one of my favourite bands "Brand New", a week after our projected graduation date! So that's exciting!
