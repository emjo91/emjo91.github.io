Entry Five

Q. Describe the difference between "gems" and "APIs".

A. Gems are helpful little tools that you can install into your command prompt to help you
fix your ruby code, or just make life easier by giving you code that someone has already 
created. API's aren't quite the same thing. They're more along the line of applications 
that you can put into your code, or widgits that connect to another source.
