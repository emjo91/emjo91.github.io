Entry 6
Q. Add a journal entry about some of the things you learned today. What is still not clear? What is beginning to feel clear? How comfortable do you feel with core ruby operations like looping through an array, compared to how you felt about that same operation a week ago?

A. Today, we learned about databases and SQLite3. Second week in and we're learning another new language (SQL). The concept is crystal clear, but then applying the concept is a different thing. Learning the syntax and commands are always tough. As far as the core ruby operations, I'm feeling pretty good about all the simple stuff like that! I'm much more at ease with it, which is awesome! I can go back and laugh at that moment last week when I was FREAKING out.
