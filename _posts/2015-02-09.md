Question
1. What is "software development" as you understand it so far? What are the moving parts? Are those always the moving parts? Are they always called the same thing?
2. Discuss at least one reason why working in a pair was valuable. (Not applicable for a couple of you. Sorry.)

Answer
1. From what I understand, or my idea of it...someone who is a software developer is someone who works with the "back-end" of a program. They create applications for people to use. They are what gives websites their functionality.
2. The most valuable thing I've pulled from paired programming, is you really have to know what you're talking about. Your partner is not inside your head, so your communication has to be as clear as possible for you to accomplish anything. You've got to be flexible, and understanding as well.
