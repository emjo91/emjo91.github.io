title:  "Emily Johnson - Entry 1"
---

I'm not quite sure if this is right...but! I'm trying it!
Three things I've learned today: 
1. The differences between objects and classes. Objects have attributes and behaviors, and classes define those objects...they create them!! 
2. I gained a MUCH better understanding of the getter and setter methods! 
c. Not really a skill that was learned here, BUT a very good life lesson. Don't compare your insides to someone's outsides. This is so important!

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Emily')
#=> prints 'Hi, Emily' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
