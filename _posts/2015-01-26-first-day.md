Today was REALLY rough, and I think everyone else can kind of agree on that. Today we went over Classes a little bit further, and I was confident...but I'm kind of kicking myself in the shins now. 

Future self: I'm working on that project with the check splitter...you did GREAT on the check splitter...but having an object with a party of individual people is NOT going so well. Hopefully you're laughing right now, because I got stressed for nothing...
